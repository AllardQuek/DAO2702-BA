    "By varying the sample size $n$, we have the following observations:\n",

    "This is because the random variable $m$ follows the binomial distribution $B(n, p)$, where its expectation is $np$. The expected value of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}=m/n$ is thus the same as the population proportion $p$, so it looks 'centered' at the true population proportion $p$. The variance of $\\hat{p}$ is $p(1-p)/n$, so the variation of $\\hat{p}$ reduces when the the sample size $n$ increases.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",

    "This is not the confidence interval yet, because we still have the unknown population proportion $p$ in both sides of the expressions. We then replace the $p$ by the estimate $\\hat{p}$, and the confidence interval can be written as\n",
