    "We often use inferential statistics to make decisions or judgments on the value of a parameter. For example, we might need to know \n",
    "1. Whether the mean lifespan of bulbs in a batch is longer than 1350 hours.\n",
    "2. If the mortality rate of a disease is lower than $1\\%$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One commonly used method for proving/disproving such theories is to perform a **hypothesis test**. A ***hypothesis*** is a statement that something is true. For example, the statement that \"The mortality rate of a disease is lower than $1\\%$\" is a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a hypothesis test involves two hypotheses: the **null hypothesis** and the **alternative hypothesis (or research hypothesis)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Notes: </b>\n",
    "    <li> The <b>null hypothesis</b> is usually the current thinking, or status quo, denoted by $H_0$ \n",
    "    <li> The <b>alternative (research) hypothesis</b>, denoted by $H_a$, is a hypothesis considered to be the alternative to the null hypothesis. It is usually the hypothesis a researcher wants to prove. The burden of proof is on the alternative hypothesis. \n",
    "    <li> <b>Hypothesis test</b>: the problem to decide whether the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Notes: Basic Logic of Hypothesis Testing: </b> Take a random sample from the population. If the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis, do not reject the null hypothesis; if the sample data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis and supportive of the alternative hypothesis, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next question is how to determine if the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis. This is answered by comparing the sample data with the sampling distribution of the estimator while assuming the null hypothesis is true. If according to the sampling distribution, we find the sample data are very unlikely to occur, then we may conclude that the sample data do not support the null hypothesis and we thus reject it. \n",

    "### Steps of the hypothesis testing <a id=\"subsection4.2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the hypothesis tests can be conducted following the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the alternative hypothesis is crucial for a hypothesis test. Based on the theory we are aimed to prove, there are three different choices.\n",
    "1. If the primary concern is to decide whether a population mean, $\\mu$, is different from a given constant value $\\mu_0$, we express the alternative hypothesis as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_a:~\\mu\\not=\\mu_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This hypothesis suggests that $\\mu$ is either larger or smaller than the constant $\\mu_0$, so such a test is called a **two-tailed test**, where $\\mu$ could vary from $\\mu_0$ in two directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the primary concern is deciding whether a population proportion, $\\mu$, is less than a given constant value $\\mu_0$, we express the alternative hypothesis as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_a:~\\mu < \\mu_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In this case, $\\mu$ is smaller than $\\mu_0$, or in other words, the test checks if $\\mu$ is on the left-hand-side of $\\mu_0$, so it is called a **left-tailed test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the primary concern is deciding whether a population proportion, $\\mu$, is greater than a given constant value $\\mu_0$, we express the alternative hypothesis as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_a:~\\mu > \\mu_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In this case, $\\mu$ is greater than $\\mu_0$, or in other words, the test checks if $\\mu$ is on the right-hand-side of $\\mu_0$, so it is called a **right-tailed test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that hypotheses always refer to population parameters, such as $\\mu$. The three types of tests also applied to population proportions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling distributions\n",
    "The sampling distribution is used to determine if the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis. From previous sections, we learned that the sampling distribution may vary in different cases:\n",
    "- Null hypothesis assumes the population mean $\\mu=\\mu_0$\n",
    "    - When the population standard deviation is known to be $\\sigma$, we choose the $\\pmb{z}$**-test** model (standard normal distribution):\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    z=\\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim N(0,~1)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    - When the population standard deviation is unknown, then the sample standard deviation $s$ is used, and we choose the $\\pmb{t}$**-test** model (Student's $t$-distribution):\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    t=\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim t\\text{-distribution with }n-1\\text{ degree of freedom}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "- Null hypothesis assumes the population proportion $p=p_0$, we choose the $\\pmb{z}$**-test** model (standard normal distribution):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z=\\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}} \\sim N(0,~1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "    <b>$P$-Value</b>: The $P$-value of a hypothesis test is the probability of getting sample data at least as inconsistent with the null hypothesis (and supportive of the alternative hypothesis) as the sample data actually obtained.\n",
